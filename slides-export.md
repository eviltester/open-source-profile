# What we will cover

---

# Everyone Can Open Source

- My relationship with Open Source
- Theory of Open Source
- Psychology and Attitude to Open Source
- Approaches and Tooling

---

# What is This Talk About?

Marketing and Sharing

- Marketing
   - Get attention, so they see what you are sharing.
   - Discoverability is vital.
- Sharing
   - Share stuff that has value, to keep attention.

---

# What is Open Source?

>"The term open source refers to **something people can modify** and share because its **design is publicly accessible**."

[opensource.com/resources/what-open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)

---

# What comes to mind when you think about open source?

- "Source Code"
- "Open Source Tools and Libraries"

e.g. WebDriver, REST Assured, Robot Framework, Tutorial Code, etc.

_Thinking like this can reduce participation to programmers only._

---

# What are some attributes of open source?

- Free to access
- Downloadable
- Source of Learning
- In a format that can be changed

---

# Going Meta

> “Reframing is also the pivotal element in the creative process: it is the ability to put a commonplace event in a new frame that is useful or enjoyable.”

― Richard Bandler, Reframing: Neurolinguistic Programming and the Transformation of Meaning

_Reframe Open Source to permit creative access to everyone._

---

# What comes to mind for: "Open"

- Welcome, Come in, Join Us
- Access, Permission, No Barrier

---

# What comes to mind for: "Source"

- "Source of Knowledge"
- To Obtain
- someone or something that supplies information
- Place where something comes from


---

# Not Code. Not Libraries.

---

# Going Meta - Beyond Code

What do you have that is:

- something people can modify?
- something people can share?
- design is publicly accessible?

Probably more than you think.

---

# Examples Beyond Code

- Social Networks sharing your sources of learning and experience
- Blogging is open sourcing your thinking
- SlideShare (etc.) for releasing presentations
- YouTube for videos and examples
- Podcasts for thoughts and interviews

---

# Used together, all of this is a content web and your online open source portfolio.

---

# 'Code' hosting

Github can be used to host more than code

- e.g. 'lists' of stuff,
- testing notes,
- the raw posts for blogs,
- 'cheat sheets'.
- etc.

---

## There are so many ways you can share your knowledge and experience and contribute to the Open Sourcing of Value.

---

# Paths to Follow

---

# An Adhoc Path

- Moments and Glimpses
    - Social Media
        - Share stuff you find interesting
    - Code Snippets on Gist
- Stakes in the Ground
    - Blog thoughts and experiences
- Incremental Development
    - Share Code as Example Projects on GitHub


   

---

# An Open Source Path Overview

- Social Media Profiles
- Social Media Platforms
- Curate Information Sources
- Share your examples
- Share your what you learned
- Product Creation
- Teach
- Build a Mixed Media Content Web

---

# Results of 25 Years Open Sourcing

---

# Some results of 25+ years of an Open Source Profile

- 670+ blog posts on multiple blogs
- 120+ Public Repositories on Github
- 320+ YouTube Videos
    - 370+ (I have some 'secret' YouTube Channels)
- 10+ Training Courses, 4+ Books, 10+ Tools

**Note: 25+ years** this is a gradual and incremental process of deliberate sharing and value add.

---

# What if we shared everything?

- Create multiple channels
- Create more options for sharing

---

---

# Psychology

---

# Motivations

---

## Personal Benefits

- Skill Improvements
- Teaching Strengthens Your Knowledge
- Experiment
- Get Your Message Out

---

## Public Benefits

- Increased Profile
- Hard to assess

Public Benefits are a Secondary Gain.

---

## No Guarantees

- Hiring Companies often don't review public profiles
- But if people look, then your public profile gives you an edge
- Sowing Seeds, Grow in Unexpected Ways

---

# Objection Handling

> Treat objections as requests for further information.

- Brian Tracy

---

![fit](images/released/atari-software-git.png)


---

# Objections

- I don't want to show my mistakes
    - Everyone makes mistakes
- I'm still learning
    - So is everyone else
    - That's why sharing is important

---

![fit](images/released/perl-smalltalk-not-expert.png)


---

# Objections

- I'm not an expert
    - We share learning and experience, not expertise
- I don't want to show my limits
    - Limits are time bound
    - Keep sharing

---

# Objections

- I might not be good enough
    - Your Experience
    - Your Learning
    - Do not compare
- I can't share my work it is proprietary
    - Generalise
    - Create new examples
    - Show what you learned through your work

---

# The more you share...

...the less you care:

- about what people think,
- or if the older stuff stinks.

You moved on,.
And to new stuff you are drawn.

---

# The "Just Share" Exercise

Every day for a week:

- create an instagram 'thoughts' video
- create a tweet about your day
- create a micro blog post

---


# Work through the objections:

- Why?
- What would happen if we did?

---

# Attitude

---

# Positive Attitude

You've got to love the:

- the output
    - what you create and share share
- the process, the act of creation
- the learning
    - improving the act of creation and sharing

---

# Because sharing takes work.

---

# Negative Reinforcement

- Not for External Reinforcement

---

# Share to Shape the world

---

> “I criticize by creation, not by finding fault.”
>
> - Marcus Tullius Cicero

---

# "I must create a system or be enslaved by another mans; I will not reason and compare: my business is to create."

## William Blake, Jerusalem

---

# Examples

Most of the examples are mine.

- Not to show off.
- But so I can explain
   - Why?
   - How?
   - What Worked?
   - What Didn't?

---

# Approaches

- Pointers to Information

# Notes

- Open Source What?
   - Share links, thoughts, pointers
   - Micro-blog through TweetStorms
- Image created in Paint.net, and getstencil.com
- Repurposing strategy
    - start on Twitter, then expand on a blog
    - write a blog, then summarise on Twitter
- Social Network? Content Sharing Platform?

---

# How to Use Twitter

- Want lots of followers?
    - Use it as a social network.
    - Follow and interact
- Discoverability (via search)
    - SEO for your profile
    - use keywords, hashtags in your posts
- Retweet and Quote
    - add value when you retweet
    - add additional hashtags

---

![fit](images/tooling/chatterscan-com.png)

---

# Chatterscan,com

- Learning from others.
- Looking for shared links to content.
- I wrote an open source tool to help me
    - [Chatterscan.com](https://chatterscan.com)
    - [github.com/eviltester/chatterscan](https://github.com/eviltester/chatterscan)

---

![fit](images/linkedin-profile.png)

---

# LinkedIn Profile Notes

- Keep it professional
- Do add personal photo
- Do add professional banner
- Do use tag line effectively
- SEO on linkedin applies to all
- Create a good description
    - read other peoples
    - use unicode for formatting


---

# Link to your projects

![right, fit](images/linkedin-accomplishments.png)

Promote your Open Source Content as projects or publications.

---

# LinkedIn Posts are Open Sourced Thinking and Sharing

- Micro Blogs
- Share Links to Content
    - Mine and Others
- Reshare other people's posts

ranked in order of success - measured by views

---

# I Avoid

- too many opinions
- non-work stuff
- but I don't use it as a social network

Find out what works for you.

---

![fit](images/tooling/linkedin-post.png)

---

# Example Post Notes

- 40,000+ views
    - organic, meaning anyone can achieve these numbers with the right post
- a Micro blog post
    - Sharing Experience and Advice
- hashtags for discoverability
- SEO keywords in text
- Repurposed from a blog post

---

# Posts are Transient

- Short Lived
- Content 'lost' over time
- Repurpose micro blogs into longer lived long form content
   - e.g. combine contents of 2 or 3 posts into a blog post or LinkedIn Article

---

![fit](images/linkedin-articles.png)

---

# Linkedin Articles are an instant blogging platform

- 'locked' to LinkedIn
- they are indexed by search engines
- can be viewed without a LinkedIn account
- metrics suggest they don't get seen as much as posts
- they are longer term
- you could start 'blogging' using LinkedIn
    - then syndicate to other sites later

---

# How to Use LinkedIn

- Share Content as Posts and Articles
- Connect, because then people see your shared content
- Connect with a message
    - No message, causes more work for the other person.
    - Do not immediately follow with an "Ask"
    - You are there to "Share", not to "Take"

---

# LinkedIn is a Content Plaform

Don't think of LinkedIn as a networking platform.

- think of it as a content sharing platform. Articles, Posts, Documents.
- and as a way of showing off any projects you are working on

---

# You don't need to wait to get started

Twitter and LinkedIn allows you to:

- blog share your knowledge
    - as long content articles
    - as micro blog 'posts' & 'tweetstorms'
    - upload media you want to open source
         - pdfs, videos
- curate content
- share links to useful information

---

# Instant Access

"I need to create a blog"

- or just start posting on Linkedin
- collate posts into an article on Linkedin
- or write docs and power points ad post them to LinkedIn or SlideShare
- Cross promote on Twitter

No Excuses. You can have a running start.

 

---

# Blogging

You can host your blog on:

- Wordpress, Blogger, Medium, etc.

If you do, add a domain name.

Use hosted service, do not self host. More secure, less maintenance.

---

# Recommended Blogging

I recommend using a static generator and hosting for free:

- Static Generator: HuGo, Jekyll

- Free Hosting: Netlify, GitPages

You can add domains you own here for free.

---

## Repurpose Content

- All content has a 'canonical form'
   - e.g. code (Github), app (hosted or download), blog post
- All content can have 'shared forms'
    - Linked to in Tweets

---

# Syndication of Blogs

- RSS feed for personal syndication
- Submit RSS feed to Aggregators
    - https://www.ministryoftesting.com/feeds/blogs
- Content Syndication via repost to
    - [Dev.to](https://dev.to), [DZone](DZone.com)
    - Medium (paywall, not used)
    - add canonical link, and edit content for backlink e.g. (originally published at ...)

---

# Key Principles

- Add Value
    - Curate, Your Experience, Your Learning
- Give more than you Ask
- Optimise for Discoverability
    - Open Sourcing Information has an advantage here

---

# Social Profiles

- Create accounts on social:
   - Twitter
   - Instagram
   - YouTube

- Use the same 'handle' if possible. But it does not matter if you can't.
- You can't share anything if you don't have access, even if you don't use it, you now have the option.

---

# PRINCIPLE: Maximise the options open to you for sharing value..

---

# Natural Style

You will have your own natural style which fits different platforms.

- Share Everything (Twitter)
- Love to Comment (Twitter, Linkedin)
- Long Form Content (Linkedin, Facebook, cross promote on Twitter)

Do what is comfortable.

---

# Own Your Platform

At some point you'll want to own your platform:

- blog, web site, etc.

So:

- GET A DOMAIN NAME
    - worry about hosting later
    - you can move and redirect later

---

# Using GitHub For Information Hosting

- Create an account
- Create a Github Readme
   - As a minimum, you could now share information through your readme.

---

![fit](images/tooling/github-readme-preview.png)

---

![fit](images/tooling/github-readme-markdown.png)

---

# Github Readme

- GitHub Readme - Frontpage of GitHub Profile

# Incredibly Low Barriers to Entry Now

---

# If you had to open source something now, what would it be?

---

# If you had to open source something now, what would stop you sharing?

- Psychology?
    - "Treat objections as requests for further information." Brian Tracy
    - Figure out your "Why?"
- Platform Access?
    - Setup accounts on all social media
    - setup a blog using GitPages, Netlilfy, Wordpress

---

# Lack of Ideas?

- Share what you learned
- Share what you experience
- Share what stopped you
- Share what you will try next

---

# Practical Steps

---

## Repurpose Transient Content

Repurpose and re-use your social content.

- Convert from micro blog to full blog post
- Curate links shared into a blog post
- Combine micro blogs and observations

---

## Watch, Star and Follow on Github

On Github:

- Star a repo to add it to your list of 'bookmarks'
- Watch a repo to receive notifications when it changes
- Follow people - helps make them easier to find again and might 'motivate' those people

---

## Sharing via Social Profiles

- Transient
- a Moment in Time
- Short Glimpses

---

## Create domain name early

- Eventually create all content under a domain you own e.g.
    - NO
        - eviltester.blogspot.com,
        - eviltester.wordpress.com
    - YES
        - EvilTester.com

Link from here to other platforms.
