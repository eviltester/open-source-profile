# What we will cover

---

## Everyone Can Open Source

- My relationship with Open Source
- Theory of Open Source
- Psychology and Attitude to Open Source
- Approaches and Tooling

---

## What is This?

- This is partly about marketing
   - Because you have to get people's attention, so they look at what you are sharing.
   - Discoverability is vital.
- This is partly about sharing
   - Because you have to share stuff that has value, to keep their attention.

Marketing == Attention

---

## What is Open Source?

>"The term open source refers to **something people can modify** and share because its **design is publicly accessible**."

[opensource.com/resources/what-open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)

---

## What comes to mind when you think about open source?

- "Source Code"
- "Open Source Tools and Libraries"

e.g. WebDriver, REST Assured, Robot Framework, Tutorial Code, etc.

_Thinking like this can reduce participation to programmers only._

---

## What are some attributes of open source?

- Free to access
- Downloadable
- Source of Learning
- In a format that can be changed

---

# Going Meta

> “Reframing is also the pivotal element in the creative process: it is the ability to put a commonplace event in a new frame that is useful or enjoyable.”

― Richard Bandler, Reframing: Neurolinguistic Programming and the Transformation of Meaning

_Reframe Open Source to permit creative access to everyone._

---

## What comes to mind for: "Open"

- Welcome, Come in, Join Us
- Access, Permission, No Barrier

---

# What comes to mind for: "Source"

- "Source of Knowledge"
- To Obtain
- someone or something that supplies information
- Place where something comes from


---

# Not Code. Not Libraries.

---

# Going Meta - Beyond Code

Your Open Source Profile

What do you have that is:

- something people can modify
- something people can share
- design is publicly accessible

## ?

Probably more than you think.

---

## Examples Beyond Code

- Social Networks sharing your sources of learning and experience
- Blogging is open sourcing your thinking
- SlideShare (etc.) for releasing presentations
- YouTube for videos and examples
- Podcasts for thoughts and interviews

Used together, all of this is a content web and your online open source portfolio.

---

## 'Code' hosting

Github can be used to host more than code

- e.g. 'lists' of stuff,
- testing notes,
- the raw posts for blogs,
- 'cheat sheets'.
- etc.

---

## So Far Beyond code

### There are so many ways you can share your knowledge and experience and contribute to the Open Sourcing of Value.

---

# Paths to Follow

---

## An Adhoc Path

This is what most people do: Follow Your Energy

- Momentary
    - Social Media
        - Share stuff you find interesting
        - Momentary Glimpses
    - Code Snippets on Gist
- Stakes in the Ground
    - Blog thoughts and experiences
- Incremental Development
    - Share Code as Example Projects on GitHub

   

---

## An Open Source Path Overview

- Social Media Profiles
- Social Media Platforms
- Curate Information Sources
- Share your examples
- Share your Experience
- Product Creation
- Teach
- Build a Mixed Media Content Web

---

# Results

---

## Some results of 25+ years of an Open Source Profile

- 670+ blog posts
    - spread across multiple blogs
- 120+ Public Repositories on Github
- 320+ YouTube Videos
    - Actually 370+ but I have some 'secret' YouTube Channels
- 10+ Training Courses, 4+ Books, 10+ Tools

**Note: 25+ years** this is a gradual and incremental process of deliberate sharing and value add.

---

# Psychology

---

# Motivations

---

## Personal Benefits

- Skill Improvements
- Teaching Strengthens Your Knowledge
- Experiment
- Get Your Message Out

---

## Public Benefits

- Increased Profile
- Hard to assess

Public Benefits are a Secondary Gain.

---

## No Guarantees

- Hiring Companies often don't review public profiles
- But if people look, then your public profile gives you an edge
- Sowing Seeds, Grow in Unexpected Ways

---

# Objections

- I don't want to show my mistakes
- I'm still learning
- I'm not an expert
- I don't want to show my limits
- I might not be good enough

---

# Objection Handling

> Treat objections as requests for further information.

- Brian Tracy

---

# Attitude

---

## Positive Attitude

You've got to love the:

- output
    - what you create and share share
- process
    - the act of creation
- learning
    - improving the act of creation and sharing

Because sharing takes work.

---

## Negative Reinforcement

- Not for External Reinforcement

---

# Share to Shape the world

---

> “I criticize by creation, not by finding fault.”

- Marcus Tullius Cicero

---

> I must create a system or be enslaved by another mans; I will not reason and compare: my business is to create.

- William Blake, Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion

---

# Examples

Most of the examples are mine.

- Not to show off.
- But so I can explain
   - Why?
   - How?
   - What Worked?
   - What Didn't?

---

## Notes

- Open Source What?
   - Share links, thoughts, pointers
   - Micro-blog through TweetStorms
- Image created in Paint.net, then moved to getstencil.com
- Repurposing strategy
    - start on Twitter, then expand on a blog
    - write a blog, then summarise on Twitter
- I don't really use it as a Social Network
    - I use it to find and share content.

---

## How to Use Twitter

- Want lots of followers?
    - Use it as a social network.
    - Follow and interact
- Discoverability (via search)
    - SEO for your profile
    - use keywords, hashtags in your posts
- Retweet and Quote
    - add value when you retweet
    - add additional hashtags

---

## Chatterscan,com

- Learning from others.
- Looking for shared links to content.
- I wrote an open source tool to help me
    - [Chatterscan.com](https://chatterscan.com)
    - [github.com/eviltester/chatterscan](https://github.com/eviltester/chatterscan)

---

## Linkedin Profile

![](images/linkedin-profile.png)

---

## LinkedIn Profile Notes

- Keep it professional
- Do add personal photo
- Do add professional banner
- Do use tag line effectively
- SEO on linkedin applies to all

---

## Link to your projects

![](images/linkedin-accomplishments.png)

Promote your Open Source Content as projects or publications.

---

## LinkedIn Posts are Open Sourced Thinking and Sharing

- Micro Blogs
- Share Links to Content
    - Mine and Others
- Reshare other people's posts

ranked in order of success - measured by views

---

## I Avoid

- too many opinions
- non-work stuff
- but I don't use it as a social network

Find out what works for you.

---

![](images/tooling/linkedin-post.png)

---

## Example Post Notes

- 40,000+ views
    - these are organic
    - meaning anyone can achieve these numbers with the right post
- a Micro blog post
    - Sharing Experience and Advice
- hashtags for discoverability
- SEO keywords in text
- Repurposed from a blog post

---

## Posts are Transient

- Short Lived
- Content 'lost' over time
- Repurpose micro blogs into longer lived long form content
   - e.g. combine contents of 2 or 3 posts into a blog post or LinkedIn Article

---

## Linkedin Articles are an instant blogging platform

![](images/linkedin-articles.png)

---

## Articles Notes

- 'locked' to LinkedIn
- they are indexed by search engines
- can be viewed without a LinkedIn account
- metrics suggest they don't get seen as much as posts
- they are longer term
- you could start 'blogging' using LinkedIn
    - then syndicate to other sites later

---

## How to Use LinkedIn

- Share Content as Posts and Articles
- Connect, because then people see your shared content
- Connect with a message
    - No message, causes more work for the other person.
    - Do not immediately follow with an "Ask"
    - You are there to "Share", not to "Take"

---

## You don't need to wait to get started

Twitter and LinkedIn are a minimal subset that allows you to:

- blog share your knowledge
    - as long content articles
    - as micro blog 'posts'
    - as micro blog 'tweetstorms'
    - upload media you want to open source
         - pdfs
         - videos
- curate content
- share links to useful information

---

## Repurpose Content

- All content has a 'canonical form'
   - e.g. code (Github), app (hosted or download), blog post
- All content can have 'shared forms'
    - Linked to in Tweets

---

## Syndication

With Blogs, you can syndicate the content.

- RSS feed for personal syndication
- Submit RSS feed to Aggregators
    - https://www.ministryoftesting.com/feeds/blogs
- Content Syndication via repost to
    - [Dev.to](https://dev.to)
    - Medium (I no longer use because of paywall)
    - [DZone](DZone.com)
    - remember to add canonical link, and edit content for backlink e.g. (originally published at ...)

---

## TweetStorms

- Threaded Tweets that act as a micro blog.
- Create by replying to an earlier Tweet.
- Often have (1/x) counts to let you know how many Tweets are in the Thread.

I wrote an open source tool that helps me create TweetStorms:

- [talotics.com/apps/tweetstormer/tweetstorm-tool](https://talotics.com/apps/tweetstormer/tweetstorm-tool/)

# Practical Steps

---

## Sharing via Social Profiles

- Transient
- a Moment in Time
- Short Glimpses

---

## Social Profiles

- Create accounts on social:
   - Twitter
   - Instagram
   - YouTube

- Use the same 'handle' if possible. But it does not matter if you can't.
- You can't share anything if you don't have access, even if you don't use it, you now have the option.

PRINCIPLE: Open your options for sharing value.

---

## Professional Profile

Create a professional profile on LinkedIn.

(minimum)

- photo
- title
- description
- current role

---

## LinkedIn is a Content Plaform

Don't think of LinkedIn as a networking platform.

- think of it as a content sharing platform. Articles, Posts, Documents.
- and as a way of showing off any projects you are working on

TODO: images etc. of my linked in profile

---

## Natural Style

You will have your own natural style which fits different platforms.

- Share Everything (Twitter)
- Love to Comment (Twitter, Linkedin)
- Long Form Content (Linkedin, Facebook, cross promote on Twitter)

---

## Instant Access

Social Platforms offer instant access to the world.

- "I need to create a blog"
- or just start posting on Linkedin
- collate posts into an article on Linkedin
- or write docs and power points ad post them to LinkedIn or SlideShare

Cross promote on Twitter

Principles: No Excuses. You can have a running start.

TODO: Images of some popular posts and stats of linkedin posts
TODO: images of articles I posted on Linkedin
 

---

## Own Your Platform

At some point you'll want to own your platform:

- blog
- web site
- etc.

So:

- GET A DOMAIN NAME  worry about hosting later


- Create it all under a domain you own e.g. NOT eviltester.blogspot.com, eviltester.wordpress.com
    - EvilTester.com
- Repurpose and re-use your social content.

---

## Watch, Star and Follow on Github

On Github:

- Star a repo to add it to your list of 'bookmarks'
- Watch a repo to receive notifications when it changes
- Follow people - helps make them easier to find again and might 'motivate' those people
