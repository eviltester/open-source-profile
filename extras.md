# Tools

## TweetStorms

- Threaded Tweets that act as a micro blog.
- Create by replying to an earlier Tweet.
- Often have (1/x) counts to let you know how many Tweets are in the Thread.

I wrote an open source tool that helps me create TweetStorms:

# Social Profiles

- Create accounts on social:
   - Twitter
   - Instagram
   - YouTube

- Use the same 'handle' if possible. But it does not matter if you can't.
- You can't share anything if you don't have access, even if you don't use it, you now have the option.

---

# PRINCIPLE: Maximise the options open to you for sharing value..

---

# Own Your Platform

At some point you'll want to own your platform:

- blog, web site, etc.

So:

- GET A DOMAIN NAME
    - worry about hosting later
    - you can move and redirect later

---

# Practical Steps

---

## Repurpose Transient Content

Repurpose and re-use your social content.

- Convert from micro blog to full blog post
- Curate links shared into a blog post
- Combine micro blogs and observations

---

## Watch, Star and Follow on Github

On Github:

- Star a repo to add it to your list of 'bookmarks'
- Watch a repo to receive notifications when it changes
- Follow people - helps make them easier to find again and might 'motivate' those people

---

## Sharing via Social Profiles

- Transient
- a Moment in Time
- Short Glimpses

---

## Create domain name early

- Eventually create all content under a domain you own e.g.
    - NO
        - eviltester.blogspot.com,
        - eviltester.wordpress.com
    - YES
        - EvilTester.com

Link from here to other platforms.

# Back in 2012 Julian Harty presented...

- Open Sourcing Testing
- http://lets-test.com/?page_id=900#panel-1053
- http://lets-test.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/
    - Open-Sourcing-Testing-for-Lets-Test-Final-Final-09-May-2012.pdf
    - [slides](http://lets-test.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Open-Sourcing-Testing-for-Lets-Test-Final-Final-09-May-2012.pdf)

And that's when I deliberately started open sourcing as much as possible.

## Repurposing

Cornerstone of Social Media Marketing and helping people find the value you share.

- Collate social shares into blog posts
- Share blog posts multiple times with a different value quote each time
- Revisit blog posts and create videos from them
- Transcribe videos and create blog posts
- Convert code examples into an explanatory blog post
- etc.

---

## Content Web

We are creating a web of related content.

And repurposing content to:

- promote and make our content discoverable
- create new content for different platforms
- add backlinks into description fields

---

## What Can I Share?

- Curated Information
- Lists of "Links"
- Lessons Learned as a 'post'
- Examples and Case Studies
    - Experience Reports
    - Code

---

## How to Find "Lists"

Many of these were taken from my 'starred' or 'watched' repo list.

I also added more by searching on github for:

- "Testing Workshop"
- "Rest Workshop"

And the wider internet for: "github awesome list"

---
